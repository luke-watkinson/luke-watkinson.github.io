        <h2>I'm a freelancer and a filmmaker based in Auckland, New Zealand.</h2>
          <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-6 columns paragraph-padding">
        <p>Specialising predominantly as a director, an editor, and a writer,I have experience across most facets of production. I work on advertorial content for web and television, freelance through agencies, and devote a generous amount of my time to making my own films.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-5 columns paragraph-padding">
        <p>My background in film means I understand the value of telling a good story, and that I excel in creating effective content with limited resources. And my experience commercially has given me confidence in making content with purpose.</p>

        <h2>I want to make stuff I would watch.</h2>
          <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-6 columns paragraph-padding">
        <p>I believe in telling stories, doing good planning, and having an expressed purpose.</p>

            <p>I'm not keen on rushing or panicking when you have to modify an idea to generate good content. I'm good at achieving a great result with few resources, but not no resources.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-5 columns paragraph-padding">
        <p>It's all about having the right ideas. Sometimes that isn't the first idea. And sometimes, whether you're working with other creatives, or clients, it's about being able to say 'no' with confidence, and cause.</p>

        <h2>I direct, edit, write, teach, and design in my freelance life.</h2>
          <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-6 columns paragraph-padding">
        <p>I've acted, supervised VFX, I've been a voice-artist, a photographer, and a videographer. And whether it's a movie or client work, whether I'm behind a camera or a computer, I tell stories.</p>
        <p>I earned my degree at Auckland University, and learned my craft in the trenches, spending long hours on film sets and in front of a computer.</p>

         <p>I've worked with clients like Immigration New Zealand, Brightcove, Canon, ASB, Dimension Data, MYOB and Air New Zealand to name a few.
